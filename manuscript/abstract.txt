We construct and analyze a covariant gravitational theory in which spacetime couples to the information structure of baryonic matter through gradients of χ ≡ ln n, where n is the rest-frame baryon-number density. The action adds a Fisher-information (FI) functional to Einstein-Hilbert.

We give:
(i) a constrained-variation derivation of the FI stress tensor and a direct conservation proof;
(ii) Newtonian/PPN limits;
(iii) quadratic stability and energy conditions;
(iv) an FRW theorem showing the FI sector is a stiff fluid (w=1) with density scaling as a^-6;
(v) a symmetry analysis (diffeomorphisms, x-shift, baryon number);
(vi) an EFT viewpoint, explicit operator basis, and screening mechanisms;
(vii) lensing/slip predictions and a qualitative RAR connection;
(viii) linear cosmological perturbations; and
(ix) a reproducible Phenomenological Methods pipeline (AIC/BIC, hierarchical Bayes, axisymmetric solvers).
